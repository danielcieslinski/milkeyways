# Keyboard manager
So far I developed small KM(keyboard manager) using python keyboard package, which has few problems.
One of them is requireing sudo for some reason

### Quick workaround

echo $env 

#  Run sudo on 
```bash
# Set 
set TMP_PY (which python)

# Check
echo $TMP_PY

# Run
sudo $TMP_PY main.py
```
